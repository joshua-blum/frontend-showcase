# Frontend Showcase

## Overview
This Next.js project is a collection of different webpage frontends mapped to different routes to showcase different types and styles of webpages. Currently, the implementation of each webpage is meant to help practice different HTML and CSS techniques within the Next.js framework. In the future, each of these webpages will have backends built to complement them, though the primary scope of this project is to gain familiarity with Next.js and with practicing advanced CSS techniques.

## Project 1 - Bonsai Marketing

* Streamlined UI
* Sticky headers

## Project 2 - Ah Studio
The second subproject of this showcase is a mockup portfolio modeled after [Oh.Studio](https://oh.studio.com)'s home page, which includes a few jumbotrons and multiple projects that would have been worked on by the portfolio owner. The primary features highlighted here are:
