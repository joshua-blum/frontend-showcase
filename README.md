# Frontend Showcase

## Overview
This Next.js project is a collection of different webpage frontends mapped to different routes to showcase different types and styles of webpages. Currently, the implementation of each webpage is meant to help practice different HTML and CSS techniques within the Next.js framework. In the future, each of these webpages will have backends built to complement them, though the primary scope of this project is to gain familiarity with Next.js

## Project 1 - Bonsai Marketing
The first subproject of this showcase will be a marketing webpage that shows the user different plans at different prices that they can choose from. The primary features highlighted here are:
* Streamlined UI
* Sticky headers
* Carousels
* Drop-down menus
* Toggle buttons (boolean switching)
